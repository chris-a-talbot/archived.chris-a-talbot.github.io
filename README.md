This is both my personal website (and, soon, blog) and the first website I've created from scratch.
My goal is to use Bootstrap 4 for page layout and responsitivity, and do the rest purely in HTML/CSS/JS.
Once I learn more web development tools, I may begin implementing more (jQuery, Node, more Bootstrap, etc.)
